A Google inspired mobile interface for TT-RSS.


This requires that your TT-RSS has external APIs enabled and the files are in a subdirectory of TT-RSS (e.g. example.com/tt-rss/m/ or example.com/tt-rss/mobile/). It is all HTML, JavaScript/jQuery, and CSS so should be fairly straight forward to customize if needed.
